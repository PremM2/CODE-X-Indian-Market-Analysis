# CODE-X-Indian-Market-Analysis
I successfully completed a real-time project named Code X, which focused on conducting a comprehensive marketing analysis for a food and beverages company operating in the Indian market. During the project, I diligently revised and modified the Excel workbook to enhance its clarity and ensure better comprehension. To leverage the power of Power BI, I utilized its functionalities to establish relationships between different datasets. Additionally, I employed the power query editor to manipulate and alter values as needed. Utilizing DAX queries, I created meaningful measures to derive valuable insights from the data.

Moving on to the report view, I carefully crafted data visualizations that effectively represented the information at hand. These visualizations were designed to improve the overall understanding of the data and generate actionable insights. To aid the Chief Marketing Officer of CODE X in gaining a deeper understanding of their business, I have attached the dashboards and PowerPoint presentation. These materials provide a comprehensive overview of the project's findings and recommendations.

In terms of recommendations, I have outlined the necessary steps that CODE X should consider in order to achieve success in the competitive Indian market. These recommendations are based on the insights obtained from the data analysis and aim to guide CODE X towards strategic decision-making. By implementing these suggested measures, CODE X can enhance its marketing strategies, optimize its operations, and capitalize on opportunities in the Indian food and beverages industry.

Overall, the completed project, accompanied by the attached dashboards and PowerPoint presentation, provides CODE X with a comprehensive understanding of the current market landscape in India and offers valuable recommendations for future success.
